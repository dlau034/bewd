# Object Oriented Secret Number
#
###############################################################################
# Lets create an Object Oriented version of our Secret Number Game.
#   
# Your updated game should have 4 classes (Main, Secret_Number, Game and Player)
#
# Below is a description of each class and some guidelines for each. 
#
# Main
#   The main class is where the game begins. The Game object should be instantiated here.
#
# Secret_Number
#   This class should handle creating and managing the secret number.
#
# Player
#  Should initialize the with the player's name and handle player responsibilities.
#
# Game
#   This class holds most of the game logic and should:
#       Welcome players and inform them of the game rules.
#       Initialize the Player class.
#       Initialize the Secret Number class.
#       Prompt the user to choose a number, verify if the user guessed correctly.
#       If the user guesses incorrectly let them know if they were too high or too low.
#       Monitor how many guesses the player has before the game is over.
#
# 
# Tips: Copy paste your code from homework 1 where necessary.
